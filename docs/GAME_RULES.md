# Jøssing Card Game Rules

## Overview

Jøssing is a trick-taking card game played with a standard 52-card deck. Players compete to predict and achieve exactly the number of tricks they will win in each section. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.

## Game Setup

### Players

- 2-8 players (optimal: 3-6 players)
- One player acts as the dealer/admin

### Deck

- Standard 52-card deck
- One card is set aside as the "trumf" (trump) indicator

### Game Length

- **"Up"**: 10 sections (sections 1-10)
- **"Up and Down"**: 20 sections (sections 1-10, then 10-1)
- **Exception**: With more than 5 players, play only as many sections as there are cards available (51 cards ÷ number of players)

## Section Structure

### Card Distribution

- **Sections 1-10**: Each player receives n cards (where n = section number)
- **Sections 11-20** (if playing "up and down"): Each player receives (21-n) cards
  - Section 11: 10 cards
  - Section 12: 9 cards
  - Section 13: 8 cards
  - ... and so on

### Trump Suit

- Before each section, all cards are shuffled
- One card is revealed to determine the trump suit for that specific section
- The trump suit changes for each section as new cards are dealt

## Gameplay

### 1. Bidding Phase

After cards are dealt for each section:

1. Players examine their cards
2. Each player secretly decides how many tricks they expect to win (0 to n, where n = number of cards in hand)
3. All players write down their bids simultaneously
4. Bids are revealed at the same time
5. The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick

### 2. Trick-Taking Phase

Each section consists of n rounds (tricks):

#### Card Play Rules

1. The lead player plays any card
2. The suit of the first card played becomes the "leading suit" for that trick
3. All other players must "follow suit" if they have cards of the leading suit
4. If a player has no cards of the leading suit, they may play any card
5. The previous trick winner leads the next trick

#### Winning Tricks

Priority order (highest to lowest):

1. **Trump cards** (highest trump wins)
2. **Leading suit cards** (if no trump is played)

Card values within each suit:

- **Ace** = highest
- **King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3**
- **2** = lowest

#### Example Trick

_3 players, Hearts is trump_

- Player 1: 10 of Clubs (leading)
- Player 2: Ace of Clubs (now winning - higher club)
- Player 3: 2 of Hearts (trump wins - lowest trump beats highest non-trump)

**Winner**: Player 3 (trump always wins)

## Scoring Systems

### Classic Scoring

- **Success** (exact bid): 10 + (number bid) points
- **Failure** (missed bid): 0 points

Examples:

- Bid 3, won 3 tricks: 13 points
- Bid 0, won 0 tricks: 10 points
- Bid 2, won 1 trick: 0 points

### Modern Scoring

- **Success** (exact bid): 5 × (number bid + 1) points
- **Failure** (missed bid): 0 points

Examples:

- Bid 3, won 3 tricks: 20 points
- Bid 0, won 0 tricks: 5 points
- Bid 2, won 1 trick: 0 points

## Game End

- After all sections are completed, sum each player's total score
- **Winner**: Player with the highest total score

## Special Rules & Clarifications

### Dealer Rotation

- The dealer rotates clockwise after each section
- In digital play, this affects bid tie-breaking

### Bid Tie-Breaking

- When multiple players bid the same highest amount, the player closest to the dealer (clockwise) leads

### Card Availability

- With many players, ensure enough cards are available for all sections
- Maximum cards needed: largest section × number of players + 1 (for trump)

### Edge Cases

- If playing "up and down" with many players, adjust the turning point to ensure card availability
- Consider using two decks for 8+ players in longer games
